# EOS is a scam

## Points
- Already has the money, create the network and then start selling the tokens to people in exchange for ether
    - This truly emulates mining, instead of spending electricity they spend normal money

- They could potentially use this to destroy the Ethereum blockchain if it transitions to proof of stake
    - Highlight the if part for ethereum

- Block.One or it’s employees have no vested interest in the success of EOS as a software
    - If they are selling off all their ETH directly, they aren’t even invested in the crypto market
    - They hold no EOS token and hence have made all the money they can possibly make
    - There is not even a business sense for developing the software, unless block.One get’s an absurd amount of money from the contracting party
        - Who is contracting block.One to develop EOS?

- The shareholders of block.One can argue that they aren’t earning any profits and hence should switch focus

- In 1 year once the software is ready, they can create another company that takes the OpenSource software and launches a crowdsale as described above to raise money again.
    - The argument being that the EOS ERC20 distribution is screwed up somehow
    - They can short the ERC20 token and announce this and then sell a new token from a different company

- Who do they think is going to launch the platform if they actually develop it?
    - My bet is that they are going to create another entity to do that and cash out twic

- They might take a pre-mine for the actual network with a new company
    - Refer to the FAQ where they state that the launching company might modify the distribution

- There will be no company or foundation to support the long-term development of EOS.
    - In the latest after the year they will just release the software and say that it’s, no it’s up to the community
