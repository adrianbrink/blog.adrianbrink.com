# Why is PoS more secure than PoW?

Btw, what are your thoughts on this scenario:
Let's say cosmos becomes as big as Bitcoin or bigger. Assume a $10 billion market cap. JP morgans and 5 other banks decide that we are a risk. They use some of their profits (JP $26 billion in a year) to buy all atoms or at least a majority by paying 5 times the market price. All of a sudden the network is controlled by a conglomerate of banks. In PoW this isn't an issue, because in the worst case you can just buy cheap commodity hardware to produce the tokens again without never having held the original token. In PoS you now can't join the system unless the banks (the conglomerate) decide to sell you some.

I think this might be the real risk behind PoS.

eh, if banks wanted to they could destroy Bitcoin with less than $1B.  They couldn’t do that w/ Cosmos.  And even if they did, as long as we could have a transparent governance process, we can see who supports what initiative, and the community can always hard-fork the banks right back out.

So both in terms of defense (banks have to pay more to buy their way in) and recovery (hard-forking bankers out is easier), PoS is superior.

Right, that’s a good point. It really relies on our governance and community mechanism though. Thanks for the explanation. I’m writing a blog post at the moment around this and started thinking about that.
Isn’t one risk though, that banks could acquire atoms in secret and just secretely control the network. Is that way we want some identified and trusted validators?
