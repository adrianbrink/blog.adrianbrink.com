# Tokens aren't Securities
- You can’t mortgage them
- You can use them as a security
- You need to secure the capital with real world assets
- Tokens are backed by the actual money that they have received
- They aren’t backed by the value of the company that issued them but rather by the real-world assets (like houses) that backed the cash that bought them
